# Income-and-Expenditure-Linear-Regression
This Project is the Analysis of Family Income and Expenditure which is in the csv file. By using libraries of python such as numpy, pandas, maplotlib, scikit learn.
It contains Correlation matrix of all the columns which defines how much each column realted to others.
Then, using Univariate Linear Regression we predicted the Total Expenditure with Total income on Scatter Graph and then used Multivariate Linear Regression So that we can get more accuracy in the prediction model. 
In the last, We did the comparison of both Univariate and Mulitvariate Linear Regression by model performance.
